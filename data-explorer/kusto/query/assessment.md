# Kusto Query Language

Kusto Query Language is a powerful tool that enables you to explore and analyze your data. You can query different kinds of data to discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and many other data-interpretation features. 
The language is expressive, the query intent easy to understand, and optimized for authoring experiences. 

Kusto Query Language is an excellent tool for querying telemetry, metrics, and logs with deep support for text search and parsing. It also includes time-series operators and functions, analytics and aggregation, geospatial, vector similarity searches, and many other language constructs that provide the optimal language for data analysis. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQLs: databases, tables, and columns.

This article provides an explanation of the query language and offers practical exercises to get you started writing queries. To access the query environment, use the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/). To learn how to use KQL, see [Tutorial: Learn common operators](tutorials/learn-common-operators.md).

The most common kind of query statement is a tabular expression **statement**, which means both its input and output consist of tables or tabular datasets. Tabular statements contain one or more **operators**, each of which starts with a tabular input and returns a tabular output. Operators are sequenced by a `|` (pipe). Data flows, or is piped, from one operator to the next. The data is filtered or manipulated at each step and then fed into the next step.

A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. The request is stated in plain text, using a data-flow model that is easy to read, author, and automate. Kusto queries are composed of one or more query statements.

There are three kinds of user [query statements](statements.md):

1. A [tabular expression statement](tabular-expression-statements.md)
1. A [let statement](let-statement.md)
1. A [set statement](set-statement.md)

All query statements are separated by a `;` (semicolon), and only affect the query at hand.

For information about application query statements, see [Application query statements](statements.md#application-query-statements).


It's like a funnel, where you start out with an an entire data table. Each time the data passes through another operator, it's filtered, rearranged, or summarized. Because the piping of information from one operator to another is sequential, the query operator order is important, and can affect both results and performance. At the end of the funnel, you're left with a refined output.

In the example query below, you see that this query has a single tabular expression statement. The statement begins with a reference to a table called *StormEvents* and contains several operators, [`where`](where-operator.md) and [`count`](count-operator.md), each separated by a pipe. The data rows for the source table are filtered by the value of the *StartTime* column and then filtered by the value of the *State* column. In the last line, the query returns a table with a single column and a single row containing the count of the remaining rows.

Note that KQL is case-sensitive for everything – table names, table column names, operators, functions – everything.

```kusto

In contrast to Kusto queries, management commands are requests for     Kusto to process or modify data or metadata. For example, the following management command creates a new Kusto table with two columns, `Level` and `Number`:

```kusto
.create table Logs (Level:string, Text:string)
```

Management commands have their own syntax, which isn't part of the Kusto Query Language syntax, although the two share many concepts. In particular, management commands are distinguished from queries by having the first character in the text of the command be a dot (the period character). A dot can't start a query. This distinction prevents many kinds of security attacks – it blocks the embedding of management commands inside queries.

Not all management commands modify data or metadata. Commands that start with `.show`, are used to display metadata or data. For example, the `.show tables` command returns a list of all tables in the current database.

For more information on management commands, see [Management commands overview](../management/index.md).
